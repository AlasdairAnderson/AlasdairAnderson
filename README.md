**`Life Long Learner`**

I am a professional working within the automotive industry but I have a passion for everthing digital. I am currently on a journey to learn how to code with the aim to land a job at a software company so that I will be able to do my passion for a living. My passions for software comes from looking at problems that I would like to solve and finding a way to solve them. Always looking for a challange to see how I can improve my skills making sure each project builds on what I learnt from the last one.

  <summary><h3>ðŸ—»My Coding Journey</summary>
   I started my coding journey at school with computer science in secondary school. After struggeling to grab the basic fundimentals in lessons due some terrable teaching, I believed that I was terrable at coding and that I would never get it. I ended up failing my exams and droped computer science as a subject, thinking that it was just not for me. Four years passed, and I had a feeling that I wanted to build something. I kept imagining of applications that I could create that could improve people's lives. So in 2023, I started my coding journey again with Harvard's "CS50 Introduction to Computer Science" and I fell in love. I finally understood concepts that seemed so complicated to me back in school. The combination of learning and problem solving had me hooked, and I never looked back. After completing and submitting my final project, I have started to look for new problems to take on that will grow my skill set and build on my knowledge. I look forward to all the challenges that I will face on this journey, but I know that I will get to my destination as long as I keep on going.Â
